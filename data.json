      "Our project began with a funny children's photo of our COO John, who comes from the faraway country of Uzbekistan. This colorful photo, in spite of its simplicity, took on a very deep meaning for us.",
      "The fact is that John unfortunately had a difficult childhood. His tyrant father sent him to a religious school where he was beaten and harassed by a teacher. Telling or complaining to his parents was not possible, as little John faced a wall of incomprehension on their part. By the way, a total lack of understanding haunted him later in life because of the mismatch between his liberal, progressive views and the religious, conservative beliefs of his environment and society.",
      "As we can see in the photo, already at such a young age John didn't give a fuck about judgment and demotivation from others. This is exactly the attitude we spread in our project and try to put it into the souls of the members of our community, because it gave John a lot.",
      "Contrary to the opinion of his parents and friends, he did what he wanted to do for a long time, he moved to Germany to study and he is doing what he really likes, namely the DGFB project, in which he sees himself as an expression. We want to help people in need of support and motivation.",
      "Speaking of this photo: in the Muslim religion it is forbidden to take a photo portrait of a person and hang it on the wall, so this is the only childhood photo John has. As a symbol of the strength and steadfastness of his progressive views, he decided to burn his only childhood photo and leave his childhood soul in the NFT space so it can find eternal happiness there. John buries his past life and gives life to our project that we believe so strongly in.",
      "From the picture of little John comes the 2D collection, and later the next phases of our project, such as the 3D animated collection and the P2E game. Our goal was to transfer exactly the emotion from the photo into the drawing format, which our designer has been working on for a long time.",
      "Our first collection aims to give people who believe in us and our project a chance to participate and contribute. P.S. The above text does not condemn any religion or views, but describes solely the life situation of our friend."
